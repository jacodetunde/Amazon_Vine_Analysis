# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
 The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

In this project, I make use of musical instruments datasets.It contains reviews of musical intsruments. I used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, I used PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
